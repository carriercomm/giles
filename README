GILES: the Great Internet Ludic Experience Server

Giles is a telnet gaming experience, meant to provide a platform for
playing various games both old and new with nothing more complicated
than a decent telnet client.

Chances are pretty good that:

    telnet ripley.thenexusproject.org 9435

will connect you to the current testing instance of Giles (unless
it's down).  Otherwise feel free to crank it up on your own.

Giles is written in Python and makes use of Miniboa, a Python telnet
server implementation.

Miniboa is released under the Apache License, version 2.0.  Giles
itself is released under the AGPL, version 3.
